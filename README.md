## Project Summary ##
This source data set contains a sample of actual responses to the American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) from residents in New York State. Each observation represents a response from a single housing unit and the sample data represents responses from approximately one percent of the United States population.

Utilizing this data set, a comparative analysis of household income was conducted based upon households with no parent present in which the household was headed by a grandparent or not headed by a grandparent.
